# Bomberman Clone

Created as a learning exercise, Bomberman Clone is a small one-man project developped by myself. 

It's purpose is to recreate the all-time classic game that is Bomberman from scratch in Unity and learn along the way.

Some of the key skills that this project helped consolidate include the following :

- Local multiplayer
- Grid based movement and gameplay
- Sprite editor and sprite sheet splicing
- Animation rendering
- Tilemap based level design

## Clone

Feel free to clone this repo on your computer with the following command :

```bash
